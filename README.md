It's my very first git ever, please don't be rude if I do something incorrectly ^^.

Game is made for 2 players. It's simple to understand but may become kinda frustrating if your opponent has super good reaction time.

You just have to click keyboard button Z (for player 1) or M (for player 2) as soon as white box becomes black.

"Player 1" is link to index.html, so you can refresh page whenever you want.

Important! I only wanted to make working algorithm, I didn't care about theme so please don't comment that. Thanks
